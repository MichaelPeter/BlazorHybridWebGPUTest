## About

This is a sample should demonstrate cross usage of WebGPU code
- In a WPF Windows App
- A Blazor Webassembly Web Application

This is achived over Windows WebView2 and Blazor Hybrid.
WebView2 uses here preview builds of edge canary.

Since WebGPU is a evolving standard for fallback reasons the babylon.js api
is used which starting with 5.0.0.0 preview supports WebGPU with a WebGL fallback.

Technologies demonstrated here:
- ASP.NET Core 6
- Blazor Webassembly
- Blazor Hybrid (over WPF)
- Typescript
- WebGPU
- babylon.js
- npm
